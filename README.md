# MineMeld configuration
MineMeld configuration for the integration with MS Graph API


* 57 miners - All out of the box from the default install and free (no API keys or account registrations required).
* 14 processors - All out of the box too.
* 3 output - The Graph API output has a maximum of one input, so I created one for each indicator type I am interested in (Domain, IPv4, and URL). In this configuration I am indeed leveraging only three processors. If I don't mistake, the Graph API output doesn't take other processor types at the moment.
